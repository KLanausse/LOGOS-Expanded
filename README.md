# Logos

My extended collection of (Taran Van Hemert) collection of mostly tech-related logos

The way these are named might be bizzare to you, but it's all so that in Explorer, (and NOT having to use the search box) I can just type the first few characters for the logo I want, and I'll get straight to it. Also I can't change the names of ones I use a lot, like Apple_logo_black 2000px.svg.png because it would break old links in old Premiere projects. So yeah lots of name weirdnesses.

## Usage

All logos belong to their respective brands. Please research the brand's guidelines on using its logo. (If you care about that sort of thing.)
